# How the OpenTUI transcript got from 686MB to ~300MB — the full story

*For: glitch. Branch: `feat/opentui-memory-window`. Everything here is measured,
not vibes; every number has a result JSON in the **tui-bench** repo's `results/` (`github.com/NousResearch/tui-bench`).*

## 1. The cast of characters (the primitives, bottom-up)

To understand where the memory went, you need to know who's holding it. Six
layers, from the screen up:

**The terminal grid.** Your terminal is a spreadsheet of character cells.
Nobody pays per-message here — tmux holds ~5MB flat no matter how long the
session is (we measured). The terminal is never the problem.

**The OpenTUI native renderer (Zig).** A compiled library that owns the
"frame buffer" — the grid of cells about to be painted. Every piece of text the
TUI shows lives in a native **TextBuffer** (the characters + their colors),
viewed through a **TextBufferView**, styled by a **SyntaxStyle**. Each of those
is a **native handle** — a ticket into one global table that has only **65,535
slots, total, ever** (16-bit indices — like a coat check with 65k hooks).
Destroying a renderable returns its tickets, so the constraint is not "how much
have you ever created" but **"how much is alive right now."**

**Renderables.** OpenTUI's UI objects — `<text>`, `<box>`, `<markdown>`,
`<code>`, `<scrollbox>`. One transcript row (a message with its tool calls,
markdown, code blocks, copy chips) is a *tree* of these: **~16 text renderables
≈ 47 native handles ≈ ~250–340KB of RSS, per row.** This is the number that
drives everything. 1,400 mounted rows × 47 handles = table full = the crash we
root-caused last week.

**Yoga (the layout engine, WASM).** Every renderable also has a Yoga node —
Yoga is the flexbox calculator that decides where boxes go. OpenTUI ships it
compiled to **WebAssembly**, and WASM has a brutal property: its memory can
**grow but never shrink** back to the OS. So the peak number of
*simultaneously-mounted* renderables sets a high-water mark you pay **forever**,
even after everything is destroyed. (Fun fact from this week's forensics: we
spent two days believing Ink had this disease. It doesn't — our Ink fork swapped
Yoga-WASM for a plain TypeScript port at fork creation. **We** are the ones
running layout in WASM. The accusation was true; we just had the defendant
wrong.)

**Solid (the view framework).** Renders each store message into a row via
`<For>`. The property we exploit: Solid mounts/unmounts *surgically* — remove a
row from what the component returns and Solid destroys exactly that row's
renderables (returning its handles and freeing its Yoga nodes), touching
nothing else. No virtual-DOM diffing, no collateral re-renders.

**V8 (the JavaScript engine) + the store.** The store keeps every message as JS
strings/objects. V8's garbage collector is *lazy by design*: with the default
8GB ceiling we launch with, it sees no reason to clean up aggressively, so RSS
includes a lot of "collectible but not yet collected" garbage. Cheap to fix,
worth real MB (measured below).

**The scrollbox.** One detail that fooled everyone at some point:
`viewportCulling` (on by default) skips *drawing* offscreen rows — but they stay
fully **mounted**: handles held, Yoga nodes alive, memory paid. Culling saves
paint time, not memory. That misunderstanding is half the reason the "rolling
store cap" was expected to be enough, and wasn't.

## 2. Why it was 686MB

Simple arithmetic. The old TUI mounted **every message in the store** as a full
renderable tree. 2,000 messages × ~16 renderables × (handles + Yoga nodes +
text buffers + V8 objects) ≈ 670–690MB, growing ~300MB per 1,000 messages. And
at ~1,400 rows the handle table filled: first a hard crash (exit 7), then —
after our containment fix — survival with **unstyled text** past that point,
plus a cap clamped from 3,000 rows down to 1,000 as the price of not crashing.

Ink, meanwhile, sat at ~234MB at the same workload, because Ink only ever
mounts the rows near your viewport (~84–400 live nodes). Its memory is the
*data* plus some caches — not the *view*.

## 3. The decisions, in order

### Decision 1: virtualize the view, don't starve the store

Two ways to cut view memory: keep fewer messages (opencode's answer — they keep
100 and delete the rest from memory; transcript truth lives on their server), or
keep all messages but only *materialize* the ones near the viewport. You vetoed
the first (your p90 session is 182 messages — a 100-row store truncates normal
sessions), so: **windowing**. Notably the OpenTUI devs confirmed this week that
framework-level virtualization is the intended path — the engine doesn't ship
it out of the box, and opencode never built it. We did.

### Decision 2: exact heights, recorded at unmount — never estimates in your face

This is the load-bearing idea, and it's where we beat Ink at its own game.

The hard problem of any virtualized list: an unmounted row still needs to
occupy its correct *height*, or the scrollbar lies and content jumps. Ink
solves it by **guessing** heights and correcting after measurement — those
corrections are precisely the 83–101ms scroll stutters you hate. You explicitly
vetoed "estimate-correction jank" as a model.

Our advantage: OpenTUI lays out with real, queryable heights. So when a row
scrolls out of the window, we record its **exact laid-out height** (an
`onSizeChange` hook fires inside layout, pre-paint) and replace the row with an
empty `<box height={exactly-that}/>` — a **spacer**: one Yoga node, zero text
buffers, zero native handles. Think of a bookshelf where books you're not
reading are swapped for cardboard sleeves cut to *exactly* the book's
thickness: the shelf never shifts, and you can't tell from across the room.

The window is your viewport ± one viewport of margin (plus hysteresis so it
doesn't thrash at the edges). Scroll near a spacer and the real row remounts —
at the recorded height, so nothing moves.

And one **law**, written into the code as `correctionIsLegal`: a spacer's
height may only ever be corrected where you *cannot see it* — fully above the
viewport (with the scroll position compensated in the same frame, so the world
doesn't move) or fully below it. A correction that would shift visible content
is forbidden, structurally. Jank isn't tuned down; it's outlawed.

### Decision 3 (the S2 insight): adjudicate on *append*, not just on scroll

S1 alone got 686 → 518MB. Why not more? Because of *when* windowing decided.
S1 re-decided the window when you **scrolled**. But during a streaming burst —
an agent turn dumping hundreds of rows — you don't scroll; rows arrive, each
mounting fully, and only get demoted later. That transient pile-up is mostly
invisible in steady-state numbers… except for Yoga-WASM, where **the transient
peak is permanent** (memory never shrinks). The burst was quietly ratcheting
the floor.

S2 makes the window recompute on **transcript growth**: while you're pinned at
the bottom, the window anchors to the content *bottom*, so a row that falls
more than a margin behind the live edge becomes a spacer the moment it's
measured — not whenever you next scroll. Measured result: across a 1,500-row
burst, the peak number of simultaneously-mounted rows is **31**.

Same trick for **resume**: opening a 2,000-message session used to mount all of
it (transient peak again — paid forever). Now resume mounts only the bottom
window; everything above starts as spacers using a line-count estimate, and an
idle-time "measure march" quietly mounts ten rows at a time near the window
edge, records their true heights, and swaps them back — all outside the
viewport, all invisible by the law above.

### Decision 4: rows that must never be windowed

Windowing has to know what it's not allowed to touch:
- **Streaming rows** — the native markdown renderer streams incrementally;
  unmounting mid-stream would restart it visibly.
- **The bottom 30 rows** — the region you actually live in.
- **Rows under a mouse selection** — the review caught that a lingering
  highlight originally froze windowing *forever* (memory regrowing silently).
  Fixed: only an active drag pauses swaps, and selected rows get pinned, so
  copy is byte-exact while everything else keeps windowing.

### Decision 5: give back the scrollback (cap 1,000 → 3,000)

The 1,000-row clamp existed only because mounted-rows == stored-rows and the
handle table dies at ~1,400. With windowing, mounted ≈ 31 regardless of store
size — so the cap went back to the originally-shipped 3,000. It's
windowing-aware: the `HERMES_TUI_WINDOWING=0` escape hatch (which mounts
everything again) keeps the safe 1,000.

### Decision 6 (measured, not yet shipped as default): right-size the V8 heap

Running the windowed TUI with a 512MB heap ceiling instead of 8GB forced V8 to
actually collect: another −90MB with zero latency cost. That's queued as a
launcher default change (~1GB), for both engines.

## 4. The scoreboard

At 2,000 messages (your real p99 session size — yes, we checked your DB:
median session is 20 messages, p99 is 1,941):

| | peak memory | scroll p99 (slowest 1-in-100) |
|---|---|---|
| OpenTUI before | 686MB | 16ms |
| + S1 windowing | 518MB | 16ms |
| + S2 append/resume windowing | **300–375MB** | **6ms** |
| Ink (reference) | 229–246MB | ~100ms |

At the **3,000-message stress** with the restored triple-size scrollback:
**360MB, fully styled, scroll p99 8ms** — a workload that six days ago crashed
the process, and three days ago survived only by dropping syntax colors.

Scroll got *faster* because there are simply fewer live renderables to walk.
The determinism gate stayed **byte-identical** — the windowed TUI's settled
frame is provably the same pixels as before. And the live smoke (2,000-message
session: full sweep to the top, resize storm, back to bottom) returned a frame
pixel-identical to boot, with deep history fully syntax-highlighted — something
the pre-windowing TUI literally could not do.

## 5. What's honestly still open

- The remaining ~60–120MB over Ink is mostly the **store's JS strings** and
  process baseline — the view is no longer the problem. The structural fix is
  the **thin renderer** (W1): bodies live in the Python gateway (which already
  has them in SQLite); the TUI keeps ~300-byte stubs and fetches bodies only
  for the window. That also fixes the class of problem neither engine handles
  today: a single 10MB tool output.
- Two accepted, documented limits: scrollbar-*jumping* deep into a freshly
  resumed session can land on estimate-height rows that snap to true height as
  they enter view (normal scrolling doesn't — the margin pre-measures; the idle
  march erodes the exposure over time), and a tool you expanded, scrolled far
  away from, then returned to will have re-collapsed (state is component-local;
  hoisting it to the store is queued).
- Everything is behind `HERMES_TUI_WINDOWING` (default on, `0` = bit-exact old
  behavior) — a one-env escape hatch if anything feels off in real use.

*Where to verify: the **tui-bench** repo's `results/` (`github.com/NousResearch/tui-bench`; every number above), the design+gates doc
`docs/plans/opentui-transcript-windowing.md`, tests in
`ui-opentui/src/test/window.test.ts` and `transcriptWindow.test.tsx` (the
zero-jank invariants are literal assertions: identical scrollHeight windowed
vs not, byte-stable frames across corrections).*
